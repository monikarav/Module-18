# SEB : Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Aim

To write a Python program to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach.

## Algorithm

1. **Input the Number of Cities**:
   - Begin by taking the number of cities as input.
   
2. **Distance Matrix**:
   - Define the distance matrix where each element `graph[i][j]` represents the distance between city `i` and city `j`.

3. **Generate All Permutations**:
   - Generate all possible permutations of the cities excluding the starting city.
   
4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Permutation**:
   - For each permutation, calculate the total distance of traveling through the cities in that order, starting and ending at the initial city.
   
5. **Track the Minimum Cost**:
   - Keep track of the minimum cost and the corresponding route.

6. **Return the Best Route and Minimum Cost**:
   - Once all permutations are evaluated, return the route with the minimum cost.

7. **End the Program**:
   - Output the minimum cost and the corresponding route.

## Program
```
from sys import maxsize
from itertools import permutations
V = 4

def travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, s):


	vertex = []
	for i in range(V):
		if i != s:
			vertex.append(i)

	min_path = maxsize
	next_permutation=permutations(vertex)
	for i in next_permutation:

		current_pathweight = 0

		k = s
		for j in i:
			current_pathweight += graph[k][j]
			k = j
		current_pathweight += graph[k][s]

		# update minimum
		min_path = min(min_path, current_pathweight)
		
	return min_path


# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":

	# matrix representation of graph
	graph = [[0, 10, 15, 20], [10, 0, 35, 25],
			[15, 35, 0, 30], [20, 25, 30, 0]]
	s = int(input())
	print(travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, s))

```

## RESULT

Thus the Python program to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach was succesfully implemented.
